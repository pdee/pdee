Python-mode commands

====================

py-guess-pdb-path
-----------------
If py-pdb-path isn't set, find location of pdb.py. 

highlight-indentation-on
------------------------
Make sure `highlight-indentation' is on. 

highlight-indentation-off
-------------------------
Make sure `highlight-indentation' is off. 

highlight-indentation
---------------------
Toggle highlight indentation.
Optional argument INDENT-WIDTH specifies which indentation
level (spaces only) should be highlighted, if omitted
indent-width will be guessed from current major-mode

run-python-internal
-------------------
Run an inferior Internal Python process.
Input and output via buffer named after
`python-shell-internal-buffer-name' and what
`python-shell-internal-get-process-name' returns.  This new kind
of shell is intended to be used for generic communication related
to defined configurations.  The main difference with global or
dedicated shells is that these ones are attached to a
configuration, not a buffer.  This means that can be used for
example to retrieve the sys.path and other stuff, without messing
with user shells.  Runs the hook
`inferior-python-mode-hook' (after the `comint-mode-hook' is
run).  (Type C-h m in the process buffer for a list
of commands.)

python-shell-send-string
------------------------
Send STRING to inferior Python PROCESS.
When `py-verbose-p' and MSG is non-nil messages the first line of STRING.

python-shell-send-region
------------------------
Send the region delimited by START and END to inferior Python process.

python-shell-send-buffer
------------------------
Send the entire buffer to inferior Python process.

python-shell-send-defun
-----------------------
Send the current defun to inferior Python process.
When argument ARG is non-nil sends the innermost defun.

python-shell-send-file
----------------------
Send FILE-NAME to inferior Python PROCESS.
If TEMP-FILE-NAME is passed then that file is used for processing
instead, while internally the shell will continue to use
FILE-NAME.

python-shell-switch-to-shell
----------------------------
Switch to inferior Python process buffer.

python-shell-completion-complete-at-point
-----------------------------------------
Perform completion at point in inferior Python process.

python-shell-completion-complete-or-indent
------------------------------------------
Complete or indent depending on the context.
If content before pointer is all whitespace indent.  If not try
to complete.

py-count-lines
--------------
Count lines in accessible part until current line.

See http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=7115

run-python
----------
Run an inferior Python process, input and output via buffer *Python*.

CMD is the Python command to run.  NOSHOW non-nil means don't
show the buffer automatically.

Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for the initial
Python command line (default is `python-command').

A new process is started if one isn't running attached to
`python-buffer', or if called from Lisp with non-nil arg NEW.
Otherwise, if a process is already running in `python-buffer',
switch to that buffer.

This command runs the hook `inferior-python-mode-hook' after
running `comint-mode-hook'.  Type C-h m in the
process buffer for a list of commands.

By default, Emacs inhibits the loading of Python modules from the
current working directory, for security reasons.  To disable this
behavior, change `python-remove-cwd-from-path' to nil.

python-send-region
------------------
Send the region to the inferior Python process.

python-send-string
------------------
Evaluate STRING in inferior Python process.

python-send-buffer
------------------
Send the current buffer to the inferior Python process.

python-send-defun
-----------------
Send the current defun (class or method) to the inferior Python process.

python-switch-to-python
-----------------------
Switch to the Python process buffer, maybe starting new process.
With prefix arg, position cursor at end of buffer.

python-send-region-and-go
-------------------------
Send the region to the inferior Python process.
Then switch to the process buffer.

python-load-file
----------------
Load a Python file FILE-NAME into the inferior Python process.
If the file has extension `.py' import or reload it as a module.
Treating it as a module keeps the global namespace clean, provides
function location information for debugging, and supports users of
module-qualified names.

python-set-proc
---------------
Set the default value of `python-buffer' to correspond to this buffer.
If the current buffer has a local value of `python-buffer', set the
default (global) value to that.  The associated Python process is
the one that gets input from M-x python-send-region et al when used
in a buffer that doesn't have a local value of `python-buffer'.

python-fill-paragraph
---------------------
`fill-paragraph-function' handling multi-line strings and possibly comments.
If any of the current line is in or at the end of a multi-line string,
fill the string or the paragraph of it that point is in, preserving
the string's indentation.

python-shift-left
-----------------
Shift lines in region COUNT (the prefix arg) columns to the left.
COUNT defaults to `py-indent-offset'.  If region isn't active, just shift
current line.  The region shifted includes the lines in which START and
END lie.  It is an error if any lines in the region are indented less than
COUNT columns.

python-shift-right
------------------
Shift lines in region COUNT (the prefix arg) columns to the right.
COUNT defaults to `py-indent-offset'.  If region isn't active, just shift
current line.  The region shifted includes the lines in which START and
END lie.

python-mark-block
-----------------
Mark the block around point.
Uses `python-beginning-of-block', `python-end-of-block'.

python-find-imports
-------------------
Find top-level imports, updating `python-imports'.

python-find-function
--------------------
Find source of definition of function NAME.
Interactively, prompt for name.

py-insert-default-shebang
-------------------------
Insert in buffer shebang of installed default Python. 

py-electric-comment
-------------------

If a numeric argument ARG is provided, that many colons are inserted
non-electrically.
With C-u "#" electric behavior is inhibited inside a string or comment.

py-electric-colon
-----------------
Insert a colon and indent accordingly.

If a numeric argument ARG is provided, that many colons are inserted
non-electrically.

Electric behavior is inhibited inside a string or
comment or by universal prefix C-u.
Default is nil, controlled by `py-electric-colon-active-p'

py-electric-backspace
---------------------
Delete preceding character or level of indentation.

With ARG do that ARG times.
Returns column reached. 

py-electric-delete
------------------
Delete following character or levels of whitespace.

With ARG do that ARG times.

py-indent-line
--------------
Indent the current line according to Python rules.

When called interactivly with C-u, ignore dedenting rules for block closing statements
(e.g. return, raise, break, continue, pass)

An optional C-u followed by a numeric argument neither 1 nor 4 will switch off `py-smart-indentation' for this execution. This permits to correct allowed but unwanted indents.
Similar to `toggle-py-smart-indentation' resp. `py-smart-indentation-off' followed by TAB.

This function is normally used by `indent-line-function' resp.
TAB.
Returns current indentation 

py-newline-and-indent
---------------------
Add a newline and indent to outmost reasonable indent.
When indent is set back manually, this is honoured in following lines. 

py-newline-and-dedent
---------------------
Add a newline and indent to one level below current.
Returns column. 

toggle-force-local-shell
------------------------
If locally indicated Python shell should be taken and
enforced upon sessions execute commands.

Toggles boolean `py-force-local-shell-p' along with `py-force-py-shell-name-p'
Returns value of `toggle-force-local-shell' switched to.

See also commands
`py-force-local-shell-on'

py-force-local-shell-on
-----------------------
Make sure, `py-py-force-local-shell-p' is on.

This is followed by one line per abbrev in that table:
NAME   USECOUNT   EXPANSION   HOOK
