The original project contains basically:

    * python-mode.el - major mode for editing Python source
    * column-marker.el
    * highlight-indentation.el
    * doctest-mode.el - major mode for editing doctest files
    * pycomplete.el - support for Python symbol completion (Emacs Lisp side)
    * pycomplete.py - support for Python symbol completion (Python side)


Remaining files provide tests and tools for developers
