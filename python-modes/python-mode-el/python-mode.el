The lines from the line containing the start of the current region up
to (but not including) the line containing the end of the region are
reindented.  If the first line of the region has a non-whitespace
character in the first column, the first line is left alone and the
rest of the region is reindented with respect to it.  Else the entire
region is reindented with respect to the (closest code or indenting
comment) statement immediately preceding the region.

This is useful when code blocks are moved or yanked, when enclosing
control structures are introduced or removed, or to reformat code
using a new value for the indentation offset.

If a numeric prefix argument is given, it will be used as the value of
the indentation offset.  Else the value of `py-indent-offset' will be
used.

Warning: The region must be consistently indented before this function
is called!  This function does not compute proper indentation from
scratch (that's impossible in Python), it merely adjusts the existing
indentation to be correct in context.

Warning: This function really has no idea what to do with
non-indenting comment lines, and shifts them as if they were indenting
comment lines.  Fixing this appears to require telepathy.

Special cases: whitespace is deleted from blank lines; continuation
lines are shifted by the same amount their initial line was shifted,
in order to preserve their relative indentation with respect to their
initial line; and comment lines beginning in column 1 are ignored."

%v:py-temp-directory
%v:py-beep-if-tab-change

@KINDS OF LINES

Each physical line in the file is either a `continuation line' (the
preceding line ends with a backslash that's not part of a comment, or
the paren/bracket/brace nesting level at the start of the line is
non-zero, or both) or an `initial line' (everything else).

An initial line is in turn a `blank line' (contains nothing except
possibly blanks or tabs), a `comment line' (leftmost non-blank
character is `#'), or a `code line' (everything else).

Comment Lines

Although all comment lines are treated alike by Python, Python mode
recognizes two kinds that act differently with respect to indentation.

An `indenting comment line' is a comment line with a blank, tab or
nothing after the initial `#'.  The indentation commands (see below)
treat these exactly as if they were code lines: a line following an
indenting comment line will be indented like the comment line.  All
other comment lines (those with a non-whitespace character immediately
following the initial `#') are `non-indenting comment lines', and
their indentation is ignored by the indentation commands.

Indenting comment lines are by far the usual case, and should be used
whenever possible.  Non-indenting comment lines are useful in cases
like these:

\ta = b # a very wordy single-line comment that ends up being
\t #... continued onto another line

\tif a == b:
##\t\tprint 'panic!' # old code we've `commented out'
\t\treturn a

Since the `#...' and `##' comment lines have a non-whitespace
character following the initial `#', Python mode ignores them when
computing the proper indentation for the next line.

Continuation Lines and Statements

The Python-mode commands generally work on statements instead of on
individual lines, where a `statement' is a comment or blank line, or a
code line and all of its following continuation lines (if any)
considered as a single logical unit.  The commands in this mode
generally (when it makes sense) automatically move to the start of the
statement containing point, even if point happens to be in the middle
of some continuation line.

@INDENTATION

Primarily for entering new code:
\t\\[indent-for-tab-command]\t indent line appropriately
\t\\[py-newline-and-indent]\t insert newline, then indent
\t\\[py-electric-backspace]\t reduce indentation, or delete single character

Primarily for reindenting existing code:
\t\\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t guess py-indent-offset from file content; change locally
\t\\[universal-argument] \\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t ditto, but change globally

\t\\[py-indent-region]\t reindent region to match its context
\t\\[py-shift-left]\t shift line or region left by py-indent-offset
\t\\[py-shift-right]\t shift line or region right by py-indent-offset

Unlike most programming languages, Python uses indentation, and only
indentation, to specify block structure.  Hence the indentation supplied
automatically by Python-mode is just an educated guess:  only you know
the block structure you intend, so only you can supply correct
indentation.

The \\[indent-for-tab-command] and \\[py-newline-and-indent] keys try to suggest plausible indentation, based on
the indentation of preceding statements.  E.g., assuming
py-indent-offset is 4, after you enter
\tif a > 0: \\[py-newline-and-indent]
the cursor will be moved to the position of the `_' (_ is not a
character in the file, it's just used here to indicate the location of
the cursor):
\tif a > 0:
\t _
If you then enter `c = d' \\[py-newline-and-indent], the cursor will move
to
\tif a > 0:
\t c = d
\t _
Python-mode cannot know whether that's what you intended, or whether
\tif a > 0:
\t c = d
\t_
was your intent.  In general, Python-mode either reproduces the
indentation of the (closest code or indenting-comment) preceding
statement, or adds an extra py-indent-offset blanks if the preceding
statement has `:' as its last significant (non-whitespace and non-
comment) character.  If the suggested indentation is too much, use
\\[py-electric-backspace] to reduce it.

Continuation lines are given extra indentation.  If you don't like the
suggested indentation, change it to something you do like, and Python-
mode will strive to indent later lines of the statement in the same way.

If a line is a continuation line by virtue of being in an unclosed
paren/bracket/brace structure (`list', for short), the suggested
indentation depends on whether the current line contains the first item
in the list.  If it does, it's indented py-indent-offset columns beyond
the indentation of the line containing the open bracket.  If you don't
like that, change it by hand.  The remaining items in the list will mimic
whatever indentation you give to the first item.

If a line is a continuation line because the line preceding it ends with
a backslash, the third and following lines of the statement inherit their
indentation from the line preceding them.  The indentation of the second
line in the statement depends on the form of the first (base) line:  if
the base line is an assignment statement with anything more interesting
than the backslash following the leftmost assigning `=', the second line
is indented two columns beyond that `='.  Else it's indented to two
columns beyond the leftmost solid chunk of non-whitespace characters on
the base line.

Warning:  indent-region should not normally be used!  It calls \\[indent-for-tab-command]
repeatedly, and as explained above, \\[indent-for-tab-command] can't guess the block
structure you intend.
%c:indent-for-tab-command
%c:py-newline-and-indent
%c:py-electric-backspace

The next function may be handy when editing code you didn't write:
%c:py-guess-indent-offset

The remaining `indent' functions apply to a region of Python code.  They
assume the block structure (equals indentation, in Python) of the region
is correct, and alter the indentation in various ways while preserving
the block structure:
%c:py-indent-region
%c:py-shift-left
%c:py-shift-right

@MARKING & MANIPULATING REGIONS OF CODE

\\[py-mark-block]\t mark block of lines
\\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing class
\\[comment-region]\t comment out region of code
\\[universal-argument] \\[comment-region]\t uncomment region of code
%c:py-mark-block
%c:py-mark-def-or-class
%c:comment-region

@MOVING POINT

\\[py-previous-statement]\t move to statement preceding point
\\[py-next-statement]\t move to statement following point
\\[py-goto-block-up]\t move up to start of current block
\\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of class
\\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of class

The first two move to one statement beyond the statement that contains
point.  A numeric prefix argument tells them to move that many
statements instead.  Blank lines, comment lines, and continuation lines
do not count as `statements' for these commands.  So, e.g., you can go
to the first code statement in a file by entering
\t\\[beginning-of-buffer]\t to move to the top of the file
\t\\[py-next-statement]\t to skip over initial comments and blank lines
Or do `\\[py-previous-statement]' with a huge prefix argument.
%c:py-previous-statement
%c:py-next-statement
%c:py-goto-block-up
%c:py-beginning-of-def-or-class
%c:py-end-of-def-or-class

@LITTLE-KNOWN EMACS COMMANDS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN PYTHON MODE

`\\[indent-new-comment-line]' is handy for entering a multi-line comment.

`\\[set-selective-display]' with a `small' prefix arg is ideally suited for viewing the
overall class and def structure of a module.

`\\[back-to-indentation]' moves point to a line's first non-blank character.

`\\[indent-relative]' is handy for creating odd indentation.

@OTHER EMACS HINTS

If you don't like the default value of a variable, change its value to
whatever you do like by putting a `setq' line in your .emacs file.
E.g., to set the indentation increment to 4, put this line in your
.emacs:
\t(setq py-indent-offset 4)
To see the value of a variable, do `\\[describe-variable]' and enter the variable
name at the prompt.

When entering a key sequence like `C-c C-n', it is not necessary to
release the CONTROL key after doing the `C-c' part -- it suffices to
press the CONTROL key, press and release `c' (while still holding down
CONTROL), press and release `n' (while still holding down CONTROL), &
then release CONTROL.

Entering Python mode calls with no arguments the value of the variable
`python-mode-hook', if that value exists and is not nil; for backward
compatibility it also tries `py-mode-hook'; see the `Hooks' section of
the Elisp manual for details.

Obscure:  When python-mode is first loaded, it looks for all bindings
to newline-and-indent in the global keymap, and shadows them with
local bindings to py-newline-and-indent."))
