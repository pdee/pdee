Minor bug: `ipython-complete' raises the prompt counter when completion done

Richard Everson commented:

    I don't know how to stop IPython from incrementing the prompt
    counter, but using py-completion-at-point just hangs emacs for
    me. If I start with a new IPython shell, then

    In [1]: import sys

    In [2]: sys.pa

    then M-x py-completion-at-point, hoping to complete to sys.path, Emacs
    hangs.  Escaping out of it shows that the \*Python\* buffer has the
    contents:

    >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'nil' is not defined
    >>> =
    [ ... ]

    On the other hand, IPython's interaction and completion itself is pretty
    impressive (for versions greater than 0.10 at least): it inserts the
    correct indentation for for, if, etc and it will show completions even
    within a loop.  Here's an example from a terminal shell:

    In [1]:

    In [1]: for i in range(3):
       ...:     print i, sys.p<------------ Pressed tab here; indentation inser=
    ted automatically
    sys.path                 sys.path_importer_cache  sys.prefix
    sys.path_hooks           sys.platform             sys.py3kwarning

@KINDS OF LINES

Each physical line in the file is either a `continuation line' (the
preceding line ends with a backslash that's not part of a comment, or
the paren/bracket/brace nesting level at the start of the line is
non-zero, or both) or an `initial line' (everything else).

An initial line is in turn a `blank line' (contains nothing except
possibly blanks or tabs), a `comment line' (leftmost non-blank
character is `#'), or a `code line' (everything else).

Comment Lines

Although all comment lines are treated alike by Python, Python mode
recognizes two kinds that act differently with respect to indentation.

An `indenting comment line' is a comment line with a blank, tab or
nothing after the initial `#'.  The indentation commands (see below)
treat these exactly as if they were code lines: a line following an
indenting comment line will be indented like the comment line.  All
other comment lines (those with a non-whitespace character immediately
following the initial `#') are `non-indenting comment lines', and
their indentation is ignored by the indentation commands.

Indenting comment lines are by far the usual case, and should be used
whenever possible.  Non-indenting comment lines are useful in cases
like these:

\ta = b # a very wordy single-line comment that ends up being
\t #... continued onto another line

\tif a == b:
##\t\tprint 'panic!' # old code we've `commented out'
\t\treturn a

Since the `#...' and `##' comment lines have a non-whitespace
character following the initial `#', Python mode ignores them when
computing the proper indentation for the next line.

Continuation Lines and Statements

The `python-mode' commands generally work on statements instead of on
individual lines, where a `statement' is a comment or blank line, or a
code line and all of its following continuation lines (if any)
considered as a single logical unit.  The commands in this mode
generally (when it makes sense) automatically move to the start of the
statement containing point, even if point happens to be in the middle
of some continuation line.

@INDENTATION

Primarily for entering new code:
\t\\[indent-for-tab-command]\t indent line appropriately
\t\\[py-newline-and-indent]\t insert newline, then indent
\t\\[py-electric-backspace]\t reduce indentation, or delete single character

Primarily for reindenting existing code:
\t\\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t guess py-indent-offset from file content; change locally
\t\\[universal-argument] \\[py-guess-indent-offset]\t ditto, but change globally

\t\\[py-indent-region]\t reindent region to match its context
\t\\[py-shift-left]\t shift line or region left by py-indent-offset
\t\\[py-shift-right]\t shift line or region right by py-indent-offset

Unlike most programming languages, Python uses indentation, and only
indentation, to specify block structure.  Hence the indentation supplied
automatically by `python-mode' is just an educated guess:  only you know
the block structure you intend, so only you can supply correct
indentation.

The \\[indent-for-tab-command] and \\[py-newline-and-indent] keys try to suggest plausible indentation, based on
the indentation of preceding statements.  E.g., assuming
py-indent-offset is 4, after you enter
\tif a > 0: \\[py-newline-and-indent]
the cursor will be moved to the position of the `_' (_ is not a
character in the file, it's just used here to indicate the location of
the cursor):
\tif a > 0:
\t _
If you then enter `c = d' \\[py-newline-and-indent], the cursor will move
to
\tif a > 0:
\t c = d
\t _
`python-mode' cannot know whether that's what you intended, or whether
\tif a > 0:
\t c = d
\t_
was your intent.  In general, `python-mode' either reproduces the
indentation of the (closest code or indenting-comment) preceding
statement, or adds an extra py-indent-offset blanks if the preceding
statement has `:' as its last significant (non-whitespace and non-
comment) character.  If the suggested indentation is too much, use
\\[py-electric-backspace] to reduce it.

Continuation lines are given extra indentation.  If you don't like the
suggested indentation, change it to something you do like, and Python-
mode will strive to indent later lines of the statement in the same way.

If a line is a continuation line by virtue of being in an unclosed
paren/bracket/brace structure (`list', for short), the suggested
indentation depends on whether the current line contains the first item
in the list.  If it does, it's indented py-indent-offset columns beyond
the indentation of the line containing the open bracket.  If you don't
like that, change it by hand.  The remaining items in the list will mimic
whatever indentation you give to the first item.

If a line is a continuation line because the line preceding it ends with
a backslash, the third and following lines of the statement inherit their
indentation from the line preceding them.  The indentation of the second
line in the statement depends on the form of the first (base) line:  if
the base line is an assignment statement with anything more interesting
than the backslash following the leftmost assigning `=', the second line
is indented two columns beyond that `='.  Else it's indented to two
columns beyond the leftmost solid chunk of non-whitespace characters on
the base line.

Warning:  indent-region should not normally be used!  It calls \\[indent-for-tab-command]
repeatedly, and as explained above, \\[indent-for-tab-command] can't guess the block
structure you intend.
%c:indent-for-tab-command
%c:py-newline-and-indent
%c:py-electric-backspace

The next function may be handy when editing code you didn't write:
%c:py-guess-indent-offset

The remaining `indent' functions apply to a region of Python code.  They
assume the block structure (equals indentation, in Python) of the region
is correct, and alter the indentation in various ways while preserving
the block structure:
%c:py-indent-region
%c:py-shift-left
%c:py-shift-right

@MARKING & MANIPULATING REGIONS OF CODE

\\[py-mark-block]\t mark block of lines
\\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-mark-def-or-class]\t mark smallest enclosing class
\\[comment-region]\t comment out region of code
\\[universal-argument] \\[comment-region]\t uncomment region of code
%c:py-mark-block
%c:py-mark-def-or-class
%c:comment-region

@MOVING POINT

\\[py-previous-statement]\t move to statement preceding point
\\[py-next-statement]\t move to statement following point
\\[py-goto-block-up]\t move up to start of current block
\\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-beginning-of-def-or-class]\t move to start of class
\\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of def
\\[universal-argument] \\[py-end-of-def-or-class]\t move to end of class

The first two move to one statement beyond the statement that contains
point.  A numeric prefix argument tells them to move that many
statements instead.  Blank lines, comment lines, and continuation lines
do not count as `statements' for these commands.  So, e.g., you can go
to the first code statement in a file by entering
\t\\[beginning-of-buffer]\t to move to the top of the file
\t\\[py-next-statement]\t to skip over initial comments and blank lines
Or do `\\[py-previous-statement]' with a huge prefix argument.
%c:py-previous-statement
%c:py-next-statement
%c:py-goto-block-up
%c:py-beginning-of-def-or-class
%c:py-end-of-def-or-class

@LITTLE-KNOWN EMACS COMMANDS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN PYTHON MODE

`\\[indent-new-comment-line]' is handy for entering a multi-line comment.

`\\[set-selective-display]' with a `small' prefix arg is ideally suited for viewing the
overall class and def structure of a module.

`\\[back-to-indentation]' moves point to a line's first non-blank character.

`\\[indent-relative]' is handy for creating odd indentation.

@OTHER EMACS HINTS

If you don't like the default value of a variable, change its value to
whatever you do like by putting a `setq' line in your .emacs file.
E.g., to set the indentation increment to 4, put this line in your
.emacs:
\t(setq py-indent-offset 4)
To see the value of a variable, do `\\[describe-variable]' and enter the variable
name at the prompt.

When entering a key sequence like `C-c C-n', it is not necessary to
release the CONTROL key after doing the `C-c' part -- it suffices to
press the CONTROL key, press and release `c' (while still holding down
CONTROL), press and release `n' (while still holding down CONTROL), &
then release CONTROL.

Entering Python mode calls with no arguments the value of the variable
`python-mode-hook', if that value exists and is not nil; for backward
compatibility it also tries `py-mode-hook'; see the `Hooks' section of
the Elisp manual for details.

Obscure:  When python-mode is first loaded, it looks for all bindings
to newline-and-indent in the global keymap, and shadows them with
local bindings to py-newline-and-indent."))

  "Function for finding Imenu definitions in Python.

Finds all definitions (classes, methods, or functions) in a Python
file for the Imenu package.

Returns a possibly nested alist of the form

        (INDEX-NAME . INDEX-POSITION)

The second element of the alist may be an alist, producing a nested
list as in

        (INDEX-NAME . INDEX-ALIST)

This function should not be called directly, as it calls itself
recursively and requires some setup.  Rather this is the engine for
the function \\[py-imenu-create-index-function].

It works recursively by looking for all definitions at the current
indention level.  When it finds one, it adds it to the alist.  If it
finds a definition at a greater indentation level, it removes the
previous definition from the alist. In its place it adds all
definitions found at the next indentation level.  When it finds a
definition that is less indented then the current level, it returns
the alist it has created thus far.

The optional argument START-INDENT indicates the starting indentation
at which to continue looking for Python classes, methods, or
functions.  If this is not supplied, the function uses the indentation
of the first definition found."

       Pyflakes is a simple program which checks Python
       source files for errors. It is similar to
       PyChecker in scope, but differs in that it does
       not execute the modules to check them. This is
       both safer and faster, although it does not
       perform as many checks. Unlike PyLint, Pyflakes
       checks only for logical errors in programs; it
       does not perform any checks on style.

       All commandline arguments are checked, which
       have to be either regular files or directories.
       If a directory is given, every .py file within
       will be checked.

       When no commandline arguments are given, data
       will be read from standard input.

       The exit status is 0 when no warnings or errors
       are found. When errors are found the exit status
       is 2. When warnings (but no errors) are found
       the exit status is 1.
