An effective way users may contribute is telling
us how Python-mode is used and which command is missed
still.

For people who want to dig into the code:
Python-mode is build around the notion of statement.
Running `py-end-of-statement',
`py-beginning-of-statement' with edebug should deliver
a way of understanding.
