;;; Commentary:

;; commands-python-mode.org in directory doc reports
;; available commands, also a menu is provided

;; as for `py-add-abbrev':
;; Similar to `add-mode-abbrev', but uses
;; `py-partial-expression' before point for expansion to
;; store, not `word'. Also provides a proposal for new
;; abbrevs.

;; Proposal for an abbrev is composed from the downcased
;; initials of expansion - provided they are of char-class
;; [:alpha:]
;;
;; For example code below would be recognised as a
;; `py-expression' composed by three
;; py-partial-expressions.
;;
;; OrderedDict.popitem(last=True)
;;
;; Putting the curser at the EOL, M-3 M-x py-add-abbrev
;;
;; would prompt "op" for an abbrev to store, as first
;; `py-partial-expression' beginns with a "(", which is
;; not taken as proposal.

Minor bug: `ipython-complete' raises the prompt counter when completion done

 Richard Everson commented:

 I don't know how to stop IPython from incrementing the prompt
 counter, but using py-completion-at-point just hangs emacs for
 me. If I start with a new IPython shell, then

 In [1]: import sys

 In [2]: sys.pa

 then M-x py-completion-at-point, hoping to complete to sys.path, Emacs
 hangs.  Escaping out of it shows that the \*Python\* buffer has the
 contents:

 >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
 File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>
 NameError: name 'nil' is not defined
 >>> =
 [ ... ]

 On the other hand, IPython's interaction and completion itself is pretty
 impressive (for versions greater than 0.10 at least): it inserts the
 correct indentation for for, if, etc and it will show completions even
 within a loop.  Here's an example from a terminal shell:

 In [1]:

 In [1]: for i in range(3):
 ...:     print i, sys.p<------------ Pressed tab here; indentation inser=
 ted automatically
 sys.path                 sys.path_importer_cache  sys.prefix
 sys.path_hooks           sys.platform             sys.py3kwarning
 ...:     print i, sys.path<------------ Pressed tab again

Pylint checks length of lines of code, if variable names are
well-formed according to your coding standard, if declared
interfaces are truly implemented, and much more. Additionally, it
is possible to write plugins.
