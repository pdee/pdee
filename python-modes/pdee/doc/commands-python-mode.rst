py-indent-region
----------------
Reindent a region of Python code.

The lines from the line containing the start of the current region up
to (but not including) the line containing the end of the region are
reindented.  If the first line of the region has a non-whitespace
character in the first column, the first line is left alone and the
rest of the region is reindented with respect to it.  Else the entire
region is reindented with respect to the (closest code or indenting
comment) statement immediately preceding the region.

This is useful when code blocks are moved or yanked, when enclosing
control structures are introduced or removed, or to reformat code
using a new value for the indentation offset.

If a numeric prefix argument is given, it will be used as the value of
the indentation offset.  Else the value of `py-indent-offset' will be
used.

Warning: The region must be consistently indented before this function
is called!  This function does not compute proper indentation from
scratch (that's impossible in Python), it merely adjusts the existing
indentation to be correct in context.

Warning: This function really has no idea what to do with
non-indenting comment lines, and shifts them as if they were indenting
comment lines.  Fixing this appears to require telepathy.

Special cases: whitespace is deleted from blank lines; continuation
lines are shifted by the same amount their initial line was shifted,
in order to preserve their relative indentation with respect to their
initial line; and comment lines beginning in column 1 are ignored.

Ignores setting of `py-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute', buffer with region stays current.

Unicode strings like u'\xA9'

py-execute-import-or-reload
---------------------------
Import the current buffer's file in a Python interpreter.

If the file has already been imported, then do reload instead to get
the latest version.

If the file's name does not end in ".py", then do execfile instead.

If the current buffer is not visiting a file, do `py-execute-buffer'
instead.

If the file local variable `py-master-file' is non-nil, import or
reload the named file instead of the buffer's file.  The file may be
saved based on the value of `py-execute-import-or-reload-save-p'.

See the `M-x py-execute-region' docs for an account of some
subtleties, including the use of the optional ASYNC argument.

This may be preferable to `M-x py-execute-buffer' because:

 - Definitions stay in their module rather than appearing at top
   level, where they would clutter the global namespace and not affect
   uses of qualified names (MODULE.NAME).

 - The Python debugger gets line number information about the functions.

py-execute-buffer
-----------------
Send the contents of the buffer to a Python interpreter.

If the file local variable `py-master-file' is non-nil, execute the
named file instead of the buffer's file.
If there is a *Python* process buffer, it is used.  
If a clipping restriction is in effect, only the accessible portion of the buffer is sent. A trailing newline will be supplied if needed.

See the `M-x py-execute-region' docs for an account of some
subtleties, including the use of the optional ASYNC argument.

py-execute-buffer-no-switch

VARIABLES

py-indent-offset		indentation increment
py-block-comment-prefix		comment string used by `comment-region'
py-shell-name		shell command to invoke Python interpreter
py-temp-directory		directory used for temp files (if needed)
py-beep-if-tab-change		ring the bell if `tab-width' is changed

py-def-or-class-beginning-position
----------------------------------
Returns beginning position of function or class definition. 

py-def-or-class-end-position
----------------------------
Returns end position of function or class definition. 

py-statement-beginning-position
-------------------------------
Returns beginning position of statement. 

py-statement-end-position
-------------------------
Returns end position of statement. 

py-current-indentation
----------------------
Returns beginning position of code in line. 

py-version
----------
Echo the current version of `python-mode' in the minibuffer.

run-python
----------
Run an inferior Python process, input and output via buffer *Python*.

CMD is the Python command to run.  NOSHOW non-nil means don't
show the buffer automatically.

Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for the initial
Python command line (default is `python-command').

A new process is started if one isn't running attached to
`python-buffer', or if called from Lisp with non-nil arg NEW.
Otherwise, if a process is already running in `python-buffer',
switch to that buffer.

This command runs the hook `inferior-python-mode-hook' after
running `comint-mode-hook'.  Type C-h m in the
process buffer for a list of commands.

By default, Emacs inhibits the loading of Python modules from the
current working directory, for security reasons.  To disable this
behavior, change `python-remove-cwd-from-path' to nil.

py-send-region
--------------
Send the region to the inferior Python process.

py-send-buffer
--------------
Send the current buffer to the inferior Python process.

py-switch-to-python
-------------------
Switch to the Python process buffer, maybe starting new process.

With prefix arg, position cursor at end of buffer.

py-send-region-and-go
---------------------
Send the region to the inferior Python process.

Then switch to the process buffer.

py-load-file
------------
Load a Python file FILE-NAME into the inferior Python process.

If the file has extension `.py' import or reload it as a module.
Treating it as a module keeps the global namespace clean, provides
function location information for debugging, and supports users of
module-qualified names.

py-set-proc
-----------
Set the default value of `python-buffer' to correspond to this buffer.

If the current buffer has a local value of `python-buffer', set the
default (global) value to that.  The associated Python process is
the one that gets input from M-x py-send-region et al when used
in a buffer that doesn't have a local value of `python-buffer'.

py-shell-redirect-send-command-to-process
-----------------------------------------
Send COMMAND to PROCESS, with output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.
With prefix arg, echo output in process buffer.

If NO-DISPLAY is non-nil, do not show the output buffer.

py-shell-complete
-----------------
Complete word before point, if any. Otherwise insert TAB. 

ipython-complete
----------------
Complete the python symbol before point. 

Only knows about the stuff in the current *Python* session.
