;;; Commentary:

;; A slightly modified `add-mode-abbrev' providing a
;; proposal for new abbrevs. Proposal is composed from
;; the initial character(s) of the expansion.

Buffer contains a header line for each abbrev table,
 which is the abbrev table name in parentheses.
This is followed by one line per abbrev in that table:
