Finds all definitions (classes, methods, or functions) in a Python

The second element of the alist may be an alist, producing a nested

This function should not be called directly, as it calls itself
recursively and requires some setup.  Rather this is the engine for
the function \\[py--imenu-create-index-function].

It works recursively by looking for all definitions at the current
indention level.  When it finds one, it adds it to the alist.  If it
finds a definition at a greater indentation level, it removes the
previous definition from the alist. In its place it adds all
definitions found at the next indentation level.  When it finds a
definition that is less indented then the current level, it returns
the alist it has created thus far.

The optional argument START-INDENT indicates the starting indentation
at which to continue looking for Python classes, methods, or
functions.  If this is not supplied, the function uses the indentation
of the first definition found."
