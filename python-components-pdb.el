We depend on the pdb input prompt matching `py-pdbtrack-input-prompt'
at the beginning of the line.

If the traceback target file path is invalid, we look for the most
recently visited python-mode buffer which either has the name of the
current function \(or class) or which defines the function \(or
class).  This is to provide for remote scripts, eg, Zope's 'Script
\(Python)' - put a _copy_ of the script in a buffer named for the
script, and set to python-mode, and pdbtrack will find it.)"

  ;; (which can be almost useless depending on Emacs version), we

  ;; check all text from comint-last-input-end to process-mark.
  ;;
  ;; Also, we're very conservative about clearing the overlay arrow,
  ;; to minimize residue.  This means, for instance, that executing
  ;; other pdb commands wipe out the highlight.  You can always do a
  ;; 'where' (aka 'w') command to reveal the overlay arrow.
