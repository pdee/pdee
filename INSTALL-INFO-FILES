After unpacking, either follow the recipes in README.md

or, when aiming for an info of a different Python
version, edit the Makefile in directory build. Replace
the hard-coded Python-version by the one you need:
Worked nicely here with Python 3.3.0

This will create `build/python.texi`.

Afterwards run `makeinfo' at the texi-file. 

In order to get them recognised by Emacs info-reader,
maybe copy the info-files into a known info-directory
and edit the "dir" file there - the head of newly
created info-files containes a line, which must appear
in file "dir".

At Linux that directory which keeps the info-files

should appear in $INFOPATH.
