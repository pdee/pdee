# Diskussions

### Costum group

Probably PDEE should get his own group

### Github or Launchpad or Others? - suitability

Still exploring Github... will it be the best we can have?

We can use Launchpad for releases and Github for coding to get the best of both worlds and communities.

### Project Management

CEDET

We can use cedet as our project management platform. We should determine what it provides and if its features are suitable for python development.

Custom Project Management

A custom library designed for python development is for sure a suitable solution. We shall see if it's convenient.

Features:

* unit-test-mode (highlight failures)
* unit-test-discovery
* code browser
