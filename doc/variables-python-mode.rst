terminated line. 

py-indent-tabs-mode
-------------------
Python-mode starts `indent-tabs-mode' with the value specified here, default is nil. 

py-smart-indentation
--------------------
Should `python-mode' try to automagically set some indentation variables?
When this variable is non-nil, two things happen when a buffer is set
to `python-mode':

    1. `py-indent-offset' is guessed from existing code in the buffer.
       Only guessed values between 2 and 8 are considered.  If a valid
       guess can't be made (perhaps because you are visiting a new
       file), then the value in `py-indent-offset' is used.

    2. `indent-tabs-mode' is turned off if `py-indent-offset' does not
       equal `tab-width' (`indent-tabs-mode' is never turned on by
       Python mode).  This means that for newly written code, tabs are
       only inserted in indentation if one tab is one indentation
       level, otherwise only spaces are used.

Note that both these settings occur *after* `python-mode-hook' is run,
so if you want to defeat the automagic configuration, you must also
set `py-smart-indentation' to nil in your `python-mode-hook'.

py-block-comment-prefix
-----------------------
String used by M-x comment-region to comment out a block of code.
This should follow the convention for non-indenting comment lines so
that the indentation commands won't get confused (i.e., the string
should be of the form `#x...' where `x' is not a blank or a tab, and
`...' is arbitrary).  However, this string should not end in whitespace.

py-indent-comments
------------------
When t, comment lines are indented. 

py-uncomment-indents-p
----------------------
When non-nil, after uncomment indent lines. 

py-separator-char
-----------------
Values set by defcustom only will not be seen in batch-mode. 

py-custom-temp-directory
------------------------
If set, will take precedence over guessed values from `py-temp-directory'. Default is the empty string.

When set, make sure the directory exists. 

py-beep-if-tab-change
---------------------
Ring the bell if `tab-width' is changed.
If a comment of the form

  	# vi:set tabsize=<number>:

is found before the first code line when the file is entered, and the
current value of (the general Emacs variable) `tab-width' does not
equal <number>, `tab-width' is set to <number>, a message saying so is
displayed in the echo area, and if `py-beep-if-tab-change' is non-nil
the Emacs bell is also rung as a warning.

py-jump-on-exception
--------------------
Jump to innermost exception frame in *Python Output* buffer.
When this variable is non-nil and an exception occurs when running
Python code synchronously in a subprocess, jump immediately to the
source code of the innermost traceback frame.

py-ask-about-save
-----------------
If not nil, ask about which buffers to save before executing some code.
Otherwise, all modified buffers are saved without asking.

py-backspace-function
---------------------

py-delete-function
------------------
Function called by `py-electric-delete' when deleting forwards.

py-pdbtrack-do-tracking-p
-------------------------
Controls whether the pdbtrack feature is enabled or not.
When non-nil, pdbtrack is enabled in all comint-based buffers,
e.g. shell buffers and the *Python* buffer.  When using pdb to debug a
Python program, pdbtrack notices the pdb prompt and displays the
source file and line that the program is stopped at, much the same way
as gud-mode does for debugging C programs with gdb.

py-pdbtrack-filename-mapping
----------------------------
Supports mapping file paths when opening file buffers in pdbtrack.
When non-nil this is an alist mapping paths in the Python interpreter
to paths in Emacs.

py-pdbtrack-minor-mode-string
-----------------------------
String to use in the minor mode list when pdbtrack is enabled.

py-import-check-point-max
-------------------------
Maximum number of characters to search for a Java-ish import statement.
When `python-mode' tries to calculate the shell to use (either a
CPython or a Jython shell), it looks at the so-called `shebang' line
-- i.e. #! line.  If that's not available, it looks at some of the
file heading imports to see if they look Java-like.

py-jython-packages
------------------
Imported packages that imply `jython-mode'.

py-current-defun-show
---------------------
If `py-current-defun' should jump to the definition, highlight it while waiting PY-WHICH-FUNC-DELAY seconds, before returning to previous position.

Default is `t'.

py-current-defun-delay
----------------------
When called interactively, `py-current-defun' should wait PY-WHICH-FUNC-DELAY seconds at the definition name found, before returning to previous position. 

py-new-shell-delay
------------------
If a new comint buffer is connected to Python, commands like completion might need some delay. 

py-send-receive-delay
---------------------
Seconds to wait for output, used by `py-send-receive'. 

py-honor-IPYTHONDIR-p
---------------------
When non-nil ipython-history file is constructed by $IPYTHONDIR
followed by "/history". Default is nil.

Otherwise value of py-ipython-history is used.

py-honor-PYTHONHISTORY-p
------------------------
When non-nil python-history file is set by $PYTHONHISTORY
Default is nil.

Otherwise value of py-python-history is used. 

py-python-history
-----------------
python-history default file. Used when py-honor-PYTHONHISTORY-p is nil (default) 

py-master-file
--------------
If non-nil, M-x py-execute-buffer executes the named
master file instead of the buffer's file.  If the file name has a
relative path, the value of variable `default-directory' for the
buffer is prepended to come up with a file name.

Beside you may set this variable in the file's local
variable section, e.g.:

    # Local Variables:
    # py-master-file: "master.py"
    # End:

  first line of input.

py-max-specpdl-size
-------------------
Heuristic exit. Limiting number of recursive calls by py-end-of-statement and related functions. Default is max-specpdl-size.

This threshold is just an approximation. It might set far higher maybe.

See lp:1235375. In case code is not to navigate due to errors, `which-function-mode' and others might make Emacs hang. Rather exit than. 

py-shell-prompt-read-only
-------------------------
If non-nil, the python prompt is read only.  Setting this
variable will only effect new shells.

py-fileless-buffer-use-default-directory-p

Customize `py-match-paren-key' which key to use. 

py-match-paren-key
------------------
String used by M-x comment-region to comment out a block of code.
This should follow the convention for non-indenting comment lines so
that the indentation commands won't get confused (i.e., the string

------------------
If t, py-indent-forward-line kills empty lines. 

py-remove-cwd-from-path
-----------------------
Whether to allow loading of Python modules from the current directory.
If this is non-nil, Emacs removes '' from sys.path when starting

See also resp. edit `py-complete-set-keymap' 

py-use-local-default
--------------------
If `t', py-shell will use `py-shell-local-path' instead
  of default Python.

Making switch between several virtualenv's easier,
 `python-mode' should deliver an installer, so named-shells pointing to virtualenv's will be available. 

py-highlight-error-source-p
---------------------------
When py-execute-... commands raise an error, respective code in source-buffer will be highlighted. Default is nil.

M-x `py-remove-overlays-at-point' removes that highlighting.

py-set-pager-cat-p
------------------
If the shell environment variable $PAGER should set to `cat'.

Execute region through `shell-command-on-region' as
v5 did it - lp:990079. This might fail with certain chars - see UnicodeEncodeError lp:550661

py-trailing-whitespace-smart-delete-p
-------------------------------------
Default is nil. When t, python-mode calls
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace nil 'local)

Also commands may delete trailing whitespace by the way.
When editing other peoples code, this may produce a larger diff than expected 

py-newline-delete-trailing-whitespace-p
---------------------------------------
Delete trailing whitespace maybe left by `py-newline-and-indent'.

Default is `t'. See lp:1100892 

py-warn-tmp-files-left-p
------------------------
Messages a warning, when `py-temp-directory' contains files susceptible being left by previous Python-mode sessions. See also lp:987534 

py-ipython-execute-delay
------------------------
Delay needed by execute functions when no IPython shell is running. 

python-shell-buffer-name
------------------------
Default buffer name for Python interpreter.

python-shell-interpreter
------------------------
Default Python interpreter for shell.

python-shell-prompt-regexp
--------------------------
Regular Expression matching top-level input prompt of python shell.
It should not contain a caret (^) at the beginning.

py-ffap-p
---------
Select python-modes way to find file at point.

Default is nil 

python-ffap-setup-code
----------------------
Python code to get a module path.

py-ffap-string-code
-------------------
Python code used to get a string with the path of a module.

py-eldoc-setup-code
-------------------
Python code to setup documentation retrieval.

py-setup-codes
--------------
List of code run by `py-shell-send-setup-codes'.

py-shell-prompt-regexp
----------------------
Regular Expression matching top-level input prompt of python shell.
It should not contain a caret (^) at the beginning.

python-shell-completion-setup-code
----------------------------------
Code used to setup completion in inferior Python processes.

python-shell-module-completion-string-code
------------------------------------------
Python code used to get completions separated by semicolons for imports.

For IPython v0.11, add the following line to
`python-shell-completion-setup-code':

from IPython.core.completerlib import module_completion

and use the following as the value of this variable:

';'.join(module_completion('''%s'''))

strip-chars-before
------------------
Regexp indicating which chars shall be stripped before STRING - which is defined by `string-chars-preserve'.

strip-chars-after
-----------------
Regexp indicating which chars shall be stripped after STRING - which is defined by `string-chars-preserve'.

py-docstring-style
------------------
Implemented styles are DJANGO, ONETWO, PEP-257, PEP-257-NN,
SYMMETRIC, and NIL.

A value of NIL won't care about quotes
position and will treat docstrings a normal string, any other
value may result in one of the following docstring styles:

DJANGO:

    """
    Process foo, return bar.
    """

    """
    Process foo, return bar.

    If processing fails throw ProcessingError.
    """

ONETWO:

    """Process foo, return bar."""

    """
    Process foo, return bar.

    If processing fails throw ProcessingError.

    """

PEP-257:

    """Process foo, return bar."""

    """Process foo, return bar.

    If processing fails throw ProcessingError.

    """

PEP-257-NN:

    """Process foo, return bar."""

    """Process foo, return bar.

    If processing fails throw ProcessingError.
    """

SYMMETRIC:

    """Process foo, return bar."""

    """
    Process foo, return bar.

    If processing fails throw ProcessingError.
    """

py-debug-p
----------
When non-nil, keep resp. store information useful for debugging.

Temporary files are not deleted. Other functions might implement
some logging etc. 

py-execute-directory
--------------------
When set, stores the file's default directory-name py-execute-... functions act upon.

Used by Python-shell for output of `py-execute-buffer' and related commands. See also `py-use-current-dir-when-execute-p'

py-use-current-dir-when-execute-p
---------------------------------
When `t', current directory is used by Python-shell for output of `py-execute-buffer' and related commands.

See also `py-execute-directory'

py-shell-prompt-output-regexp
-----------------------------
Regular Expression matching output prompt of python shell.
It should not contain a caret (^) at the beginning.

py-keep-windows-configuration
-----------------------------
If a windows is splitted displaying results, this is directed by variable `py-split-windows-on-execute-p'. Also setting `py-switch-buffers-on-execute-p' affects window-configuration. While commonly a screen splitted into source and Python-shell buffer is assumed, user may want to keep a different config.

See lp:1239498

Setting `py-keep-windows-configuration' to `t' will restore windows-config regardless of settings mentioned above. However, if an error occurs, it's displayed.

To suppres window-changes due to error-signaling also, set `py-keep-windows-configuration' onto 'force

Default is nil 

py-output-buffer
----------------


py-underscore-word-syntax-p
---------------------------
If underscore chars should be of syntax-class `word', not of `symbol'.

Underscores in word-class makes `forward-word' etc. travel the indentifiers. Default is `t'.
