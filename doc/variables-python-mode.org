See lp:1207405 resp. `py-electric-colon-active-p'

Normally python-mode, resp. inferior-python-mode know best which function to use.

** py-encoding-string
   Default string specifying encoding of a Python file. 

** py-shebang-startstring
   Detecting the shell in head of file.

** py-jython-command-args
   List of string arguments to be used when starting a Jython shell.

** py-cleanup-temporary
   If temporary buffers and files used by functions executing region should be deleted afterwards. 

** py-execute-no-temp-p
   Seems Emacs-24.3 provided a way executing stuff without temporary files. 

** py-lhs-inbound-indent
   When line starts a multiline-assignment: How many colums indent should be more than opening bracket, brace or parenthesis. 

** py-continuation-offset
   Additional amount of offset to give for some continuation lines.
Continuation lines are those that immediately follow a backslash
terminated line. 

** py-indent-tabs-mode
   Python-mode starts `indent-tabs-mode' with the value specified here, default is nil. 

** py-smart-indentation
   Should `python-mode' try to automagically set some indentation variables?
When this variable is non-nil, two things happen when a buffer is set
to `python-mode':

    1. `py-indent-offset' is guessed from existing code in the buffer.
       Only guessed values between 2 and 8 are considered.  If a valid
       guess can't be made (perhaps because you are visiting a new
       file), then the value in `py-indent-offset' is used.

    2. `indent-tabs-mode' is turned off if `py-indent-offset' does not
       equal `tab-width' (`indent-tabs-mode' is never turned on by
       Python mode).  This means that for newly written code, tabs are
       only inserted in indentation if one tab is one indentation
       level, otherwise only spaces are used.

Note that both these settings occur *after* `python-mode-hook' is run,
so if you want to defeat the automagic configuration, you must also
set `py-smart-indentation' to nil in your `python-mode-hook'.

** py-block-comment-prefix
   String used by M-x comment-region to comment out a block of code.
This should follow the convention for non-indenting comment lines so
that the indentation commands won't get confused (i.e., the string
should be of the form `#x...' where `x' is not a blank or a tab, and
`...' is arbitrary).  However, this string should not end in whitespace.

** py-indent-comments
   When t, comment lines are indented. 

** py-uncomment-indents-p
   When non-nil, after uncomment indent lines. 

** py-separator-char
   Values set by defcustom only will not be seen in batch-mode. 

** py-custom-temp-directory
   If set, will take precedence over guessed values from `py-temp-directory'. Default is the empty string.

When set, make sure the directory exists. 

** py-beep-if-tab-change
   Ring the bell if `tab-width' is changed.
If a comment of the form

  	# vi:set tabsize=<number>:

is found before the first code line when the file is entered, and the
current value of (the general Emacs variable) `tab-width' does not
equal <number>, `tab-width' is set to <number>, a message saying so is
displayed in the echo area, and if `py-beep-if-tab-change' is non-nil
the Emacs bell is also rung as a warning.

** py-jump-on-exception
   Jump to innermost exception frame in *Python Output* buffer.
When this variable is non-nil and an exception occurs when running
Python code synchronously in a subprocess, jump immediately to the
source code of the innermost traceback frame.

** py-ask-about-save
   If not nil, ask about which buffers to save before executing some code.
Otherwise, all modified buffers are saved without asking.

** py-backspace-function
   Function called by `py-electric-backspace' when deleting backwards.

** py-delete-function
   Function called by `py-electric-delete' when deleting forwards.

** py-pdbtrack-do-tracking-p
   Controls whether the pdbtrack feature is enabled or not.
When non-nil, pdbtrack is enabled in all comint-based buffers,
e.g. shell buffers and the *Python* buffer.  When using pdb to debug a
Python program, pdbtrack notices the pdb prompt and displays the
source file and line that the program is stopped at, much the same way
as gud-mode does for debugging C programs with gdb.

** py-pdbtrack-filename-mapping
   Supports mapping file paths when opening file buffers in pdbtrack.
When non-nil this is an alist mapping paths in the Python interpreter
to paths in Emacs.

** py-pdbtrack-minor-mode-string
   String to use in the minor mode list when pdbtrack is enabled.

** py-import-check-point-max
   Maximum number of characters to search for a Java-ish import statement.
When `python-mode' tries to calculate the shell to use (either a
CPython or a Jython shell), it looks at the so-called `shebang' line
-- i.e. #! line.  If that's not available, it looks at some of the
file heading imports to see if they look Java-like.

** py-jython-packages
   Imported packages that imply `jython-mode'.

** py-current-defun-show
   If `py-current-defun' should jump to the definition, highlight it while waiting PY-WHICH-FUNC-DELAY seconds, before returning to previous position.

Default is `t'.

** py-current-defun-delay
   When called interactively, `py-current-defun' should wait PY-WHICH-FUNC-DELAY seconds at the definition name found, before returning to previous position. 

** py-send-receive-delay
   Seconds to wait for output, used by `py-send-receive'. 

** py-honor-IPYTHONDIR-p

followed by "/history". Default is nil.

Otherwise value of py-ipython-history is used. 

** py-ipython-history
   ipython-history default file. Used when py-honor-IPYTHONDIR-p is nil (default) 

** py-honor-PYTHONHISTORY-p
   When non-nil python-history file is set by $PYTHONHISTORY
Default is nil.

Otherwise value of py-python-history is used. 

** py-python-history
   python-history default file. Used when py-honor-PYTHONHISTORY-p is nil (default) 

** py-master-file
   If non-nil, M-x py-execute-buffer executes the named
master file instead of the buffer's file.  If the file name has a
relative path, the value of variable `default-directory' for the
buffer is prepended to come up with a file name.

Beside you may set this variable in the file's local
variable section, e.g.:

    # Local Variables:
    # py-master-file: "master.py"
    # End:

`...' is arbitrary).  However, this string should not end in whitespace.

** py-kill-empty-line
   If t, py-indent-forward-line kills empty lines. 

** py-remove-cwd-from-path
   Whether to allow loading of Python modules from the current directory.
If this is non-nil, Emacs removes '' from sys.path when starting
an inferior Python process.  This is the default, for security
reasons, as it is easy for the Python process to be started
without the user's realization (e.g. to perform completion).

** py-imenu-show-method-args-p

Default is nil.
See also resp. edit `py-complete-set-keymap' 

** py-use-local-default

 `python-mode' should deliver an installer, so named-shells pointing to virtualenv's will be available. 

** py-highlight-error-source-p
   When py-execute-... commands raise an error, respective code in source-buffer will be highlighted. Default is nil.

M-x `py-remove-overlays-at-point' removes that highlighting.
 

** py-set-pager-cat-p
   If the shell environment variable $PAGER should set to `cat'.

If `t', use `C-c C-r' to jump to beginning of output. Then scroll normally.

v5 did it - lp:990079. This might fail with certain chars - see UnicodeEncodeError lp:550661

** py-trailing-whitespace-smart-delete-p
   Default is nil. When t, python-mode calls
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace nil 'local)

Also commands may delete trailing whitespace by the way.
When editing other peoples code, this may produce a larger diff than expected 

** py-newline-delete-trailing-whitespace-p
   Delete trailing whitespace maybe left by `py-newline-and-indent'.

Default is `t'. See lp:1100892 

** py-warn-tmp-files-left-p

** strip-chars-before
   Regexp indicating which chars shall be stripped before STRING - which is defined by `string-chars-preserve'.
