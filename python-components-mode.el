;;; Commentary:

;; See documentation in README.org, README.DEVEL.org

;; commands-python-mode.org in directory "doc" reports
;; available commands, also a menu is provided

;; as for `py-add-abbrev':
;; Similar to `add-mode-abbrev', but uses
;; `py-partial-expression' before point for expansion to
;; store, not `word'. Also provides a proposal for new
;; abbrevs.

;; Proposal for an abbrev is composed from the downcased
;; initials of expansion - provided they are of char-class
;; [:alpha:]
;;
;; For example code below would be recognised as a
;; `py-expression' composed by three
;; py-partial-expressions.
;;
;; OrderedDict.popitem(last=True)
;;
;; Putting the curser at the EOL, M-3 M-x py-add-abbrev
;;
;; would prompt "op" for an abbrev to store, as first
;; `py-partial-expression' beginns with a "(", which is
;; not taken as proposal.
