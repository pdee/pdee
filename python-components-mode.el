;;; Commentary:

;; commands-python-mode.org in directory doc reports
;; available commands, also a menu is provided

;; as for `py-add-abbrev':
;; Similar to `add-mode-abbrev', but uses
;; `py-partial-expression' before point for expansion to
;; store, not `word'. Also provides a proposal for new
;; abbrevs.

;; Proposal for an abbrev is composed from the downcased
;; initials of expansion - provided they are of char-class
;; [:alpha:]
;;
;; For example code below would be recognised as a
;; `py-expression' composed by three
;; py-partial-expressions.
;;
;; OrderedDict.popitem(last=True)
;;
;; Putting the curser at the EOL, M-3 M-x py-add-abbrev
;;
;; would prompt "op" for an abbrev to store, as first
;; `py-partial-expression' beginns with a "(", which is
;; not taken as proposal.

Pylint checks length of lines of code, if variable names are
well-formed according to your coding standard, if declared
interfaces are truly implemented, and much more. Additionally, it
is possible to write plugins.

Hooks `comint-mode-hook' and `inferior-python-mode-hook' are run in
that order.

You can send text to the inferior Python process from other buffers
containing Python source.
 * \\[py-switch-to-python] switches the current buffer to the Python
    process buffer.
 * \\[py-send-region] sends the current region to the Python process.
 * \\[py-send-region-and-go] switches to the Python process buffer
    after sending the text.
For running multiple processes in multiple buffers, see `run-python' and
`python-buffer'.
