# This script tests Emacs python-mode.

# Caveats:
#
# needs being started in `test' directory
# optional shell argument PATH/TO/EMACS-SOURCE-DIRECTORY might be given
#
# If testing with emacs-24 please be aware of bug 11984 [0], for the
# time being the patch will need to be added manually.
#
# IPython 0.12 due to a bug in argparse requires a patch [1] to work.
