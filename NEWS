Python Mode News
================

New in version 6.0.11
---------------------

- improved Pymacs based code completion:
  - Completion of symbols from imported modules, functions, classes,
    module/class-level data members and instance variables in the current
    buffer. The information for this completion is updated whenever the file
    is saved.
  - Completion of local variables and function parameters.
  - Type deduction from constructor calls and literals.
  - Show help for modules, classes and functions.
  - Go to definition of modules, classes and functions.
  - Show signature of functions.
  - Support for auto-complete and company.

- remote shell support

- extended version of smart-operator added
  original smart-operator.el authored by
  William Xu <william.xwl@gmail.com>
  Url: http://xwl.appspot.com/ref/smart-operator.el

- py-electric-colon extended
  if `py-electric-colon-newline-and-indent-p' is non-nil,
  `py-electric-colon' calls `newline-and-indent'

- boolean `py-no-completion-calls-dabbrev-expand-p'
  If completion function should call dabbrev-expand
  when no completion found. Default is `t'

- boolean `py-shell-prompt-read-only', default t
  sets `comint-prompt-read-only', avoid unintentional edits

- customizable history variables/files
  py-python-history defaults to "~/.python_history"
  py-ipython-history defaults to "~/.ipython/history"

  If py-honor-PYTHONHISTORY-p is `t', $PYTHONHISTORY takes precedence, default is nil
  If py-honor-IPYTHONDIR-p is `t', $IPYTHONHISTORY precedes, default is nil

- customizable boolean `py-trailing-whitespace-smart-delete-p'
  Default is nil. Some commands may delete trailing
  whitespaces by the way. When editing other peoples
  code, this may produce a larger diff than expected 

New in version 6.0.10
--------------------

addresses bugs and speed issues


New in version 6.0.9
--------------------

- autopair-mode delivered
  Credits to Joao Tavora http://autopair.googlecode.com
  see README-AUTOPAIR.org for details

- Syntax highlighting in Python-shell buffers enabled
  boolean `py-fontify-shell-buffer-p', default is nil

- py-add-abbrev, new command
  Similar to `add-mode-abbrev', but uses
  `py-partial-expression' before point for expansion to
  store, not `word'. Also provides a proposal for new
  abbrevs.

  Proposal for an abbrev is composed from the downcased
  initials of expansion - provided they are of char-class
  [:alpha:]

  For example code below would be recognised as a
  `py-expression' composed by three
  py-partial-expressions.

  OrderedDict.popitem(last=True)

  Putting the curser at the EOL, M-3 M-x py-add-abbrev

  would prompt "op" for an abbrev to store, as first
  `py-partial-expression' beginns with a "(", which is
  not taken as proposal.

- py-edit-abbrevs
  Jumps to `python-mode-abbrev-table' 

- modeline enhanced
  when a path/to/my/favoured/Python is given with `py-shell-name'
  the Python-shell buffer before would display

  *ND path/to/my/favoured/Python* 

  now:

  *ptmfP Python*

  boolean `py-modeline-display-full-path-p' 
  boolean `py-modeline-acronym-display-home-p'  
  If the modeline acronym should contain chars indicating the home-directory.

- mode-line indicates "Py" by default
  customize  `python-mode-modeline-display' 

- Pymacs intergration dropped from trunk
  conflicts with classic install being reported

New in version 6.0.8

--------------------

- `py-pep8-run', new command checking formatting
   `py-pep8-help'

- `py-pyflake-run', new command 
   Pyflakes is a simple program which checks Python
   source files for errors. - It is similar to
   PyChecker in scope, but differs in - that it does
   not execute the modules to check them.
   `py-pyflake-help'

- `py-pylint-run', new command calls Pylint, 
  a Python source code analyzer which looks for
  programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard
  and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in Martin
  Fowler's Refactoring book) . 

  Pylint checks length of lines of code, if variable
  names are well-formed according to your coding
  standard, if declared interfaces are truly
  implemented, and much more. Additionally, it is
  possible to write plugins.
  `py-pylint-doku', `py-pylint-help'

- py-pyflakespep8-run, combines calls to pyflakes and pep8
  
- respective flymake-modes,
  `pyflakespep8-flymake-mode', `pylint-flymake-mode'
  etc. See meny PyTools

New in version 6.0.7
--------------------

- make every Python shell acces its own history-file
  .python3_history
  .python_history
  .ipython_history etc.

- related to shell used
  `toggle-force-py-shell-name-p'
  `force-py-shell-name-p-on'/off

  making it easier to enforce default py-shell upon execution

  `toggle-force-local-shell'
  `py-force-local-shell-on'/off

  If locally indicated Python shell should be taken and
  enforced upon sessions execute commands, lp:988091

- specific completion:
  py-python2-shell-complete, py-python3-shell-complete,
  py-python2-script-complete, py-python3-script-complete

New in version 6.0.6
--------------------

- files inside a virtual machine made visible for pdbtrack

- new commands `py-toggle-split-windows-on-execute', ...-on, ...-off
  `py-toggle-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute', ...-on, ...-off
  allow `py-execute-buffer' etc. to split/not-split windows,
  move cursor onto output or not

- Behavior of C-u M-x `py-shell' closer to common shell

  C-u 4 prompts for a buffer,
  i.e. when a "*Python*" shell is running,
  C-u M-x `py-shell' opens a "*Python<2>*" per default
  C-u 2 M-x py-shell promts for command-arguments as known from 5th-series

- `py-intend-tabs-mode' sets default of `indent-tabs-mode', lp:953765

-- New boolean variable `py-intend-tabs-mode'
  Permits value independent from Emacs-wide `indent-tabs-mode'
  Commands `py-toggle-indent-tabs-mode', ...-on, ...-off
  menu PyTools "Toggle indent-tabs-mode"

- Extended py-execute-... forms provided for "line"

- new commands py-beginning/end-of-line
  while introduced for internal reasons --because of it's
  return values-- they allow repeats, i.e. when already
  at end-of-line, jumping to next end etc.

- new boolean `py-force-py-shell-name-p'
  When `t', execution with Python specified in `py-shell-name' is en  forced, shebang will have no effect. Default is nil.

-  customizable `py-separator-char', a string, see report lp:975539
  Precedes guessing when not empty, is returned by
  function `py-separator-char'

- nicer `org-cycle' behavior: when new `py-org-cycle-p' it `t',
  command `org-cycle' is available at shift-TAB, <backtab>

New in version 6.0.5
--------------------

- Menu reworked and extended

- extended commands combine executing statement/block... with dedidi  cated/switch... etc. This may remove some need of customization.

- local environments support started
  If calls to common `py-shell' should use local executable
  instead of default system Python set
  `py-use-local-default' alongside with
  `py-shell-local-path'

- `py-toggle-shells' alias of more powerful `py-switch-shells'
  Toggles between the interpreter customized in `py-shell-toggle-1' resp. `py-shell-toggle-2'. Was hard-coded CPython and Jython in earlier versions, now starts with Python2 and Python3 by default.

- `py-shell-name' accepts PATH/TO/EXECUTABLE
  in addition to name of an installed default Python-Shell.
  Permits installing commands like
  (defun python-XYZ-shell (&optional argprompt)
    "Start an Python-XYZ interpreter ... "
    (interactive)
    (let ((py-shell-name "PATH/TO/PYTHON-XYZ"))
      (py-shell argprompt)))

-  new commands `indent-tabs-mode', `toggle-indent-tabs-mode',
  `indent-tabs-mode-on', `indent-tabs-mode-off'

  feature after a request at Stack Exchange asked Jul
  13 '11 at 13:23 saying
  `tab-width' now follows `py-indent-offset'

- new command `py-execute-region-default' forces the
  systems default Python interpreter to execute, ignores
  shebang

  related functions redesigned, `async' argument dropped
  `py-execute-region' now reads:

  (defun py-execute-region (start end &optional shell dedicated)
    "Send the region to a Python interpreter.

  When called with \\[univeral-argument], execution through `default-value' of `py-shell-name' is forced.
  When called with \\[univeral-argument] followed by a number different from 4 and 1, user is prompted to specify a shell. This might be the name of a system-wide shell or include the path to a virtual environment.

  When called from a programm, it accepts a string specifying a shell which will be forced upon execute as argument. "
  [ ... ]

- new `py-number-face',
  visible only when customized and `py-use-number-face-p' is `t',
  inherits default face
  With large files fontifying numbers may cause a delay
  Credits to github.com/fgallina/python.el/issues42

- new boolean `py-verbose-p'
  if `t', reached indent level etc. is messaged

- new commands py-execute-buffer-dedicated, py-execute-buffer-switch  -dedicated

- `toggle-py-smart-indentation' new command
   also `py-smart-indentation-on', -off

New in version 6.0.4
--------------------

- Python shell starts with `python-mode'
  that's needed by completion for now
  boolean customizable `py-start-run-py-shell'

- outline-(minor-)mode enabled providing regular
  expressions. Customize `py-outline-minor-mode-p' to
  switch it on with python-mode

- Hook delivered to start hs-minor-mode from python-mode
  Customize `py-hide-show-minor-mode-p'
  Key setting example:
  (global-set-key [(super s)] 'hs-hide-all)
  (global-set-key [(super S)] 'hs-show-all)

- Listing of available commands in org-mode and reST
  format in directory "doc"

- Python shells and executing forms may be called as
  dedicated process. See commands available \w suffix
  "-dedicated".

- completion fixed: M-TAB completes in Python buffer, TAB
  completes in Python shells

- py-down-FORM-lc commands
  Goto beginning of line following end of FORM.
  \"-lc\" stands for \"left-corner\" - a complementary command travelling left, whilst `py-end-of-FORM' stops at right corner.
  Implemented forms are "block", "clause", "def", "class", "statement".

- py-down-FORM commands

  like py-down-block introduced in version 6.0.3,
  implemented also for "clause", "def", "class",
  "statement".
  Go to the beginning of next block below
  current level.

New in version 6.0.3
--------------------

- ipython integration started

- commands `ipython', `python2', `python3', `jython', `python'
  opening a respective python shell

-  py-shift-block-left, py-shift-block-right etc.
  Implemented forms that way are
  "paragraph" "block" "clause" "def" "class" "line" "statement"

- py-dedent
  Dedent line according to `py-indent-offset'. With
  arg, do it that many times. If point is between
  indent levels, dedent to next level. Stops at BOL.
  Returns column reached, if dedent done, nil otherwise.

- py-indent-forward-line
  Indent line and move one line forward. If
  `py-kill-empty-line' is non-nil, delete an empty
  line. When closing a form, use py-close-block et al,
  which will move and indent likewise. Returns position.

- py-close-block, -clause, -def, class
  Set indent level to that of beginning of definition.
  If final line isn't empty and
  `py-close-block-provides-newline' non-nil, insert a
  newline. Returns column.

- new commands specifying the shell override
  `py-shell-name' for execution
  implemented shells are "python" "python2" "python2.7"
  "python3" "python3.2" "jython"

  available with default, -switch and -no-switch
  option, i.e.
  py-execute-region-python3.2
  py-execute-region-python3.2-switch
  py-execute-region-python3.2-no-switch etc.

  Docstring of py-execute-region-python3.2-switch for
  example: "Send the region to a common shell calling the
  python3.2 interpreter. Ignores setting of
  `py-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute', output-buffer
  will being switched to."

- Declarations
  Deal with assigments resp. statements in current
  level which don't open blocks. Provides common edit
  functions as copy, mark, kill, goto beg/end.

  Functions will be used typically to grasp
  initialisations resp. assignements of variables
  between the definition of a class or method and it's
  body, likewise global stuff at the head of a file.

- column-marker.el
  Commands `column-marker-1', `column-marker-2', and
  `column-marker-3' each highlight a given column
  (using different background colors by default).

  M-x column-marker-1 highlights the column where the
  cursor is, in face `column-marker-1'.

  C-u 70 M-x column-marker-2 highlights column 70 in
  face `column-marker-2'.

  C-u 70 M-x column-marker-3 highlights column 70 in
  face `column-marker-3'. The face `column-marker-2'
  highlighting no longer shows.

  C-u M-x column-marker-3 turns off highlighting for
  column-marker-3, so face `column-marker-2'
  highlighting shows again for column 70.

  C-u C-u M-x column-marker-1 (or -2 or -3) erases all
  column highlighting.

  Thanks a lot to it's author Rick Bielawski <rbielaws@i1.net>,
  to Drew Adams for his care and Emacs Wiki hosting it.

New in version 6.0.2
--------------------

- py-electric-comment

  "Insert a comment. If starting a comment, indent
   accordingly. If a numeric argument ARG is provided,
   that many colons are inserted non-electrically. With
   universal-prefix-key C-u a \"#\" Electric behavior
   is inhibited inside a string or comment."

- New commands `py-partial-expression':

  "." operators delimit a partial-expression on it's
  level.

  Given the function below, `py-partial-expression'
  called at pipe symbol would copy and return:

  def usage():
      print """Usage: %s
      ....""" % (
          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------|-------------------------
  ==> path

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------------|-------------------
  ==> basename(sys.argv[0]))

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  --------------------------|-----------
  ==> sys

          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))
  ------------------------------|-------
  ==> argv[0]

  while `py-expression' would copy and return

  (
          os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))

  ;;;;;

  Also for existing commands a shorthand is defined:

  (defalias 'py-statement 'py-copy-statement)

  which will mark, copy and return.

- Commands implementing a behavior which customizing of
 `py-shell-switch-buffers-on-execute' would do:

  py-execute-buffer-no-switch
  py-execute-buffer-switch
  py-execute-region-no-switch
  py-execute-region-switch

- Several bugfixes.

New in version 6.0.1
--------------------

- New commands py-expression:

  py-copy-expression
  py-mark-expression
  py-beginning-of-expression
  py-end-of-expression
  py-kill-expression

  Also several of bugfixes are done.

New in version 6.0
--------------------

- Finer grained commands, core re-write.

  As shown below for the `mark'-command, delete,
  copy, jump to beginning and end of the respective
  programming-expressions:

  py-mark-statement
  py-mark-block
  py-mark-block-or-clause
  py-mark-def
  py-mark-def-or-class
  py-mark-class
  py-mark-clause

- Also a couple of bugfixes are done.

New in version 5.2.1
--------------------

- Syntax highlight as a keyword "lambda:" just like "lambda x:".  Given by Dan
  Davison.
- Add "python3" as a key for python-mode in interpreter-mode-alist and
  auto-mode-alist.

New in version 5.2.0
--------------------

- Fixed filling of triple-quoted strings.

- Add new font-lock faces for class names and exception names.

- Do not fill when calling fill-paragraph with point in a region of code.

- Fixed font-locking of exception names in parenthesized lists.

- Fixed font-locking of decorators with arguments.

- Fixed font-locking of triple-quoted strings; single quotes appearing in
  triple-quoted strings no longer upset font-locking.

- Fixed the stack-entry regexp used by pdbtrack so that it now works with
  module-level frames.

- Do not bind C-c C-h; `py-help-at-point' is now on C-c C-e by default.

- hide-show mode is now supported.

- When shifting regions right and left, keep the region active in Emacs.
