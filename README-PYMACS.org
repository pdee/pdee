* In case `Pymacs' was installed via `make' on your system, don't
  activate inlined one.  Keep `py-load-pymacs-p' nil.

  Otherwise setting `py-load-pymacs-p' to `t' should enable a
  company-based auto-completion - alongside with
  `py-company-pycomplete-p'.

  On systems which run Python3 as default
  setting
  export PYMACS_PYTHON=python2
  was reported being useful.
  Newer Pymacs should not need this.
