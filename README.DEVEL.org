* General 

  python-mode.el is composed from components-python-mode directory
  using `components2pythonmode' shell-script

  Get its source-files doing
  
  bzr branch lp:python-mode/components-python-mode
  
  An effective way users may contribute is telling
  us how Python-mode is used and which command is missing
  still.
  
  For people who want to dig into the code:
  
  Major parts deal with editing and running of
  Python code - start with edit-commands.
  It's built around the notion of a statement.
  Putting `py-end-of-statement',
  `py-beginning-of-statement' under edebug should deliver
  a way into the code.

  No need for compiling. However when compiled files exist, don't
  forget to re-compile before running it, else an existing older
  compiled file is loaded - see docstring of `load'.

* Output buffers
  There will be
  - one set internally to process, where the real work is done:
    py-buffer-name
  - a generic one, results may arrive finally, visible for user:
    py-output-buffer
  Commands might set their output-buffers, "*Python Completions*" for example.

* Organizing source code to edit Python
  Commands are grouped by action WRT Python forms
** beginning of FORM / end of FORM
*** end of FORM left corner
** mark FORM
**  copy FORM
**  kill FORM
**  delete FORM
** up Form
** down form

* Organizing source code to run Python
  A `py-python-' form may have a `py-ipython' sibling
  Likewise `py--python'
