An effective way users may contribute is telling
us how Python-mode is used and which command is missing
still.

For people who want to dig into the code:

Major parts deal with editing and running of
Python code - start with edit-commands.
It's built around the notion of a statement.
Putting `py-end-of-statement',
`py-beginning-of-statement' under edebug should deliver
a way into the code.

When re-loading source, don't forget to re-compile
before running it, else an existing older compiled file
is loaded - see docstring of `load'.

only triggers the bug, when run interactively, not from batch-mode
