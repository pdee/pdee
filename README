* Welcome to Python Development Emacs Environment - PDEE

Originating from Grabriele Lanaros's
`emacs-for-python', PDEE collects and customizes
resources reachable from Emacs to obtain a really
modern and exciting (yet stable) way to edit Python
files.

** Features

Coming with a bunch of files, PDEE makes it easy to run
what's needed.

*** Python Related

    - Ropemacs (Custom) : A refactoring library
    - Auto Completion with rope (Custom) : Tested to work well with Rope
    - Flymake + pyflakes (Custom): Highlight errors on the fly, improved
      from the standard version
    - Virtualenv : Original, In-development tool for using virtualenv in
      Emacs.
    - Custom Yasnippet Snippets
    - Cython Mode: a mode for highlighting cython files
    - Choice of available basic python-modes.

*** Editing Packages

    - Open Next Line: C-o will open a line under the cursor (very
      similar to vim o)
    - Auto Completion: Auto complete anything in Emacs
    - Yasnippet: Snippets on steroids
    - Parentheses pairing (Custom): Bug-free parentheses pairing using
      skeletons.
    - smart-operator: Automatically adds spaces around arithmetic operators.
    - code folding

** Installation

Make sure, the path is set and the PDEE init file gets
loaded, add these lines to your Emacs initialisation
file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/pdee/")
(defvar pdee-install-dir "path/to/pdee/")
(load-file "/path/to/pdee/pdee-init.el")

Maybe have a look at the following issues too

*** Configuring the _flymake_ checker

To configure the pyflakes checker install it and
put in your customization file (.emacs):

(pdee-setup-checker "pyflakes %f")

Obviously you can substitute the ``"pyflakes %f"`` with wathever you
want, you just have to keep in mind that ``%f`` will be substituted
with the file which is being checked.

*** Adding the django snippets
The django snippets comes as an option, you can load them using:

(pdee-django-snippets)

** License

This is mostly a distribution with some little tweaks, with respect of
the licenses, my tweaks are distributed according to the term of the
GNU GPL license, described in the file COPYING.

Generally each file has its own license and copyright notice (most, if
not all of packages are GPL), the license of rope (GPL) is in
rope-dist/COPYING.
